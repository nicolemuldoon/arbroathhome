### Who am I?
My name is Nicole Muldoon, and my student number at the University of Aberdeen is '52093049'.

### Why did you choose this design?
Before I even began coding my web page, I had already selected the image I wanted to use for the header. With a license purchased from Shutterstock, I decided to use this image as I enjoyed the colours on it - I thought it really brought the viewer into the page with the contrasting oranges and purples. I used a colour picker in Photoshop to decide the colour of the navigation bar and headers, selecting one of the purple hues from the sky in the header image.

I wanted the page to feel concise and clean, almost minimalistic in some elements (the design of the columns with the white background and subtle light purple borders). Based off of this, I chose to stick to the purple theme of the header. The background of the page itself is also a barely-light purple, adding to the consistency of the design.

The layout I selected as it felt easy to read (from left to right for most elements), meaning users do not have to struggle to find what information connects with what. I chose images that reflected the information I was displaying on the page, to keep up with the consistent theme of relativity. 

### What challenges I faced:
Probably the biggest challenge I faced was trying to make the web page responsive to browser width - including images,text and columns themselves. I had issues where images and text would overlap the boundaries I created for individual columns, which I managed to fix by introducing responsive elements from Bootstrap, including the use of media queries to adjust the size of images and text when the page was made smaller.

Often when I added in new code, something would 'break' so it was a lot of trial and error to make elements flow with each other correectly without interference to either parent elements or children.

I also did not realise that CSS linked in HTML files loaded in the order they were coded into the sheet initially, which I fixed by moving 'style.css' in the HTML above the bootstrap elements.
