                    <h1>Essential Experiences</h1>
                    <p>Arbroath is home to a vast number of amenities that tourists and locals can explore. Three of these experiences are highlighted in the ‘Places to Visit’ tab and include:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                        <li>Arbroath Abbey</li>
                        <li>St. Vigeans Nature Trail</li>
                        <li>Arbroath Cliffs</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>There are a number of other locations throughout the town filled with activities suitable for young children and adults alike.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.pleasurelandarbroath.co.uk/" target=”_blank”>Pleasureland</a> is an activity centre located along the West Links that has indoor and outdoor activities, including bungee jumping, an arcade, a jungle gym for toddlers and rides such as a Waltzer, bumper cars and carousels within. </p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.chalmersfilmhouse.co.uk/" target=”_blank”>Chalmers Filmhouse</a> is located in close proximity to Pleasureland and offers cinema experiences for all age groups. The cinema is fairly relaxed in comparison to most chain-owned cinemas, with sofas and cushions to allow a comfortable viewing experience.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://jumpingjoeysarbroath.com/" target=”_blank”>Jumping Joey’s</a> is a soft play centre located nearby the West Links also, with its main attraction being the indoor jungle gym suitable for children of different age groups. It also hosts an outdoor play park.</p>
                    <p>For those who would prefer a more scenic experience, <a href="https://www.angus.gov.uk/leisure_tourism_and_the_outdoors/arbroath_harbour" target=”_blank”>Arbroath Harbour</a> is a beautiful, seaside environment where there is opportunity for boat rides and a chance to talk to local fishermen or enjoy some ice cream from one of the local ice cream parlours along the coast.</p>
                    <p>Those interested in leisure activities may wish to visit one of the two <strong>swimming centres</strong> in town, located at either Arbroath High School or the <a href="https://redlion-holidaypark.com/seafront-leisure-centre/" target=”_blank”>Red Lion Caravan Park</a>. Being close to Carnousite, the home of golf, Arbroath also prides itself on its own <a href="https://www.arbroathgolfcourse.co.uk/" target=”_blank”>golf course</a>, located at the edge of town. A miniature golf course and <strong>skate park</strong> can also be found at the West Links.</p>

                    <h1 style="border:none; text-transform:uppercase; padding-top:20px;">Arbroath Abbey</h1>
                    <p style="padding-top:0;">Arbroath Abbey was originally founded by King William in 1178, and acted as a monastery for Tironesian Benedictine monks. It fell into ruins 
                    in the late 16th century, due to continous England attacks, as well as accidental and purposeful arson. It remained in disrepair until the 19th century, 
                    whereby the town's council acted to restore and preserve the ruins.</p>
                    <p>Arbroath Abbey is historically important to the Scottish Wars of Independence — in 1320, a document was commissioned to Pope John XXII titled the Declaration of Arbroath 
                    which solidified Scotland's place as an independent country, free from English reign. It is well known amongst locals that the Declaration of Independence of 
                    the United States of America is heavily influenced by this historic document.</p>
                    <p>Today, it can be accessed via purchasing tickets from Arbroath Visitor Centre and Exhibition, which can be bought <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/arbroath-abbey/">online</a> or outside the abbey on 
                    Abbey Street, DD11 1EG. The abbey also has a souvenier shop, where visitors can purchase trinkets as a reminder of their visit.</p>

                    <p>St. Vigeans Nature Trail is situated in a small village, that is roughly a thirty minute walk from the High Street of Arbroath. The picturesque trail is popular with dog walkers and recreationists and follows alongside a quiet, countryside road, giving visitors the option to enjoy a peaceful walk surrounded by nature.</p>
                    <p>The entrance to the trail is also situated just outside St Vigeans Church, a local Church of Scotland parish founded in ancient times which visitors can enter during its active hours. Nearby the Church are various stones of Pictish origin, ancient people who lived in the area from 3rd to 10th Century.</p>
